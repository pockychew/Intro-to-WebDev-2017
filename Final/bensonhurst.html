    <div class="desc">Houses like these pop up as soon as Novemember comes around. Although the area is a bit further into Dyker Heights rather than Bensonhurst, people living in the latter won't lose out in Christmas spirit. As you walk down the streets on cold winter nights, you will always be warmed by the brilliant lights coming from decorations.</div>

    <div class="desc">Street fairs and festivals are not uncommon. This one in particular is the locally well-known 86th Street Festival that comes around once every summer. People set up spots they they rent out for $125 - $350 during the festival and sell whatever items they have from handbags, sunglasses, and toys to a variety of foods and drinks.</div>

    <div class="desc">Delis and mini-markets are EVERYWHERE. Literally every other street has one. Convenience when living in Bensonhurst is not a problem. Need milk? Walk down the street. A cold drink on a hot summer's day? Walk down the street.</div>

    <div class="desc">Bensonhurst is also very convenient when it comes to transportation since the entire area is basically under a train track. Specifically - the NYC Subway's D train. This picture shows the back end of Avenue U's D train station. Because of this transportation convenience, lots of stores are located near entrances and exits to attract customers.</div>

    </a>
    <div class="desc">Another train station - this time at 79th Street. This station is also part of the D train line. These places are very crowded during rush hour because of the growing number of people who take the D train everyday. Despite such a public area - it stations like this one can get dangerous late at night.</div>

    <div class="desc">Lots of stores open up near these train station to attract customers when they go to get on or get off the train. More specifically, the stores sell fast food like the Pizzaria shown because people are always hungry after their commute.</div>

    <div class="desc">The 25th Street D train station brings back memories because near the station is a "all you can eat" shushi resturant named, <i>Sake Sushi</i>. During my high school days, me and my friends would always eat here after exams and in the summer we would bet on who could eat the most wasabi.</div>
