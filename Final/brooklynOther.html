    <div class="desc">This picture of sunset park shows the view from the top of a hill at the park and as you can see, it can be quite satisfying as you see not only Brooklyn but also Manhattan in the background.</div>

    <div class="desc">This view is of Brooklyn's well-known Sunset Park. Coincidentally, the picture captures a sunset in the park. During the fourth of July, many people from all over come to the top of this hill to watch the fireworks as well. </div>

    <div class="desc">Another view of the Manhattan Bridge at DUMBO. Many times, a artist's work of a sculpture is presented here. In this picture Deborah Kass' OY/YO sculpture can be seen. If you're in the park facing the Manhattan skyline, the sculpture reads, "YO". But, if you're viewing the sculpture from across the river in Manhattan, it reads, "OY".</div>

    <div class="desc">Brooklyn's well known stained glass house sculpture at DUMBO Park (DUMBO stands for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass). During sunny days like the one shown in the picture, sunlight hits the sculpture and colors gleam off the glass primarily in reds, purples, and indigos. Compared to the metallic silver cityscape background, and blue ocean and sky, the structure stands out perfectly.</div>

    <div class="desc">In order to mollify the residents of Brooklyn Heights, city planner Robert Moses built this park atop the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway to muffle the street noise when when it opened in 1950. Today, you might forget that traffic is moving along beneath you while strolling the esplanade. The picture-perfect views of Manhattan, the Brooklyn Bridge and the Statue of Liberty are admittedly distracting.</div>

    <div class="desc">One of New York's most beautiful outdoor places, the garden is located next to the Brooklyn Museum and is right on the edge of Prospect Park. The Japanese Hill and Pond Garden, constructed in 1914 and recently restored, is one of the finest representations of its kind outside Japan.</div>

    <div class="desc">A surreal long exposure of Coney Island through the day. Flocks of people visit Coney Island despite the time of day. Sun has set? No problem, visit the rides and enjoy the lights of the ferris wheel. People from all over the world visit this park every year to experice the atmosphere and ride the famous Coney Island Cyclone. The New York Aquarium is also located here and attracts more crowds on top of those already coming to visit the beach in the summer.</div>

    <div class="desc">The Coney Island area of the borough of Brooklyn (actually a peninsula, not an island) was once the playground of the rich and famous. Wealthy New Yorkers flocked there as early as the mid-1800s to enjoy a stay at the beautiful hotels and bathhouses that had sprung up along waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Today Coney Island is a somewhat antiquated, albeit entertaining curiosity with its amusement park, wooden boardwalk and kitschy hot dog and pizza stands. </div>

    <div class="desc">A lesser known area, this is Brooklyn's version of Chinatown. This Chinatown is only a fraction of a size of Manhattan's. During the 1980s and 1990s, the majority of newly arriving Fuzhou immigrants were settling within Manhattan's Chinatown, and the first Little Fuzhou community emerged in New York City within Manhattan's Chinatown; by the 2000s, however, the center of the massive Fuzhou influx had shifted to Brooklyn's Chinatown, which is now home to the fastest growing and perhaps largest Fuzhou population in New York City as well as causing the ethnic enclave to develop more fully and expand much further.</div>
